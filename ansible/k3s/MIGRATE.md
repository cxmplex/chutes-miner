## Overview

This playbook (`playbooks/migrate.yml`) automates the migration of nodes from a MicroK8s-based Chutes deployment to a K3s-based deployment. It handles the complete migration workflow including node removal, system reset, setup, and re-registration.

The migration process transforms your infrastructure from MicroK8s to K3s while preserving node information and ensuring a smooth transition with minimal downtime.

### Process Overview

1. **Sets up the K3s control plane** on new k3s control node
2. **Migrates worker nodes** from MicroK8s to K3s in a controlled manner
    - This is a serial process. If a node fails it will stop the entire migration so you can resolve it. This way you are only migrating one node at a time and your score should be impacted in any significant way.
3. **Preserves node metadata** (GPU types, costs) during migration
4. **Handles failure scenarios** with migration markers to prevent re-processing

## Prerequisites

### Infrastructure Requirements

- **Control plane node**: A dedicated node to run the K3s control plane
- **Microk8s nodes**: Existing MicroK8s nodes to be migrated
- **Network connectivity**: All nodes must have a public IP
- **SSH access**: Ansible must have sudo access to all nodes

### Software Requirements

- Ansible 2.15+
- Python 3.x
- `chutes-miner-cli` package (>=0.2.0, installed automatically)
- Bittensor hotkey for existing microk8s cluster

### Configuration Files

- **Inventory file**: `inventory.yml` with proper node groupings
- **Hotkey file**: Valid Bittensor wallet hotkey
- **Variables**: Configuration in `vars/migrate.yml`

## Migration Guide

## 1. Configuration

### Migration Configuration (`vars/migrate.yml`)

```yaml
# CLI execution location
run_cli_locally: false  # Set to true to run chutes-miner commands from Ansible controller

remote_hotkey_path: /etc/chutes-miner/hotkey.json # Path on host if running CLI remotely
copy_hotkey_to_ansible_host: false # If running CLI from ansible hosts, set to true to copy hotkey automatically

# API configuration
miner_api_port: 32000  # Node port to use for miner API if running from ansible controller
```

### Auto-Generated Variables

The playbook automatically generates `vars/chutes_nodes.yml` containing node information needed to add nodes to the new control plane.

```yaml
chutes_nodes:
  node-name:
    hourly_cost: "0.50"
    gpu_type: "a6000"
  ...
```

### Local Chutes Configuration 

Follow steps 2 and 3 from the [deployment docs](../../README.md#2-configure-prerequisites) to setup the necessary configuration for the control node and gpu nodes before actually running any migration steps.

Once you have the local configuration files setup, update them to include the microk8s group as shown below:

```yaml
all:
  children:
    control: # New control node for K3s.  This MUST be a new node, can not reuse existing microk8s node
      hosts:
        ...
    workers: # Existing GPU nodes from microk8s inventory go in this group
      hosts:
        ...
    microk8s:  # Existing MicroK8s control plane (chutes-miner-cpu-0) from your microk8s inventory
      hosts:
        chutes-miner-control-0: # Note the naming convention (cpu-0 -> control-0).
          ansible_host: 198.51.100.1
```
**IMPORTANT: Note the naming convention for the microk8s group.  This ensures the name does not conflict with the new control host**

## 2. Migration

**NOTE** All ansible commands must be run from the `ansible/k3s` directory.

### 2.1: Control Plane Setup

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ~/chutes/inventory.yml playbooks/migrate.yml --tags setup-control-plane
```

**What happens:**
- Installs and configures K3s on control node
- Sets up monitoring
- Installs the chutes-miner charts on the control node
- Configures networking and certificates

### 2.2 Migration Preparation

#### Verify Chutes components

Run the migration prep phase of the ansible playbooks.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ~/chutes/inventory.yml playbooks/migrate.yml --tags migrate-prep
```

**What happens:**
- Verifies `chutes-miner-cli` installation
- Checks Chutes components readiness
    * Removes the unsupported legacy audit exporter CronJob
    * Overwrites the gepetto configmap to avoid reconciliation loops overriding each other
    * Ensure miner credentials exist in the k3s control plane
- Gathers node information (costs, GPU types)
- Creates `vars/chutes_nodes.yml`

### 2.3 Node Migration

**IMPORTANT**: Before starting the node migration, verify gepetto on the microk8s control plane restarted succesfully to ensure it has the modified code.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ~/chutes/inventory.yml playbooks/migrate.yml --tags migrate-nodes
```

The node migration is a serial process, meaning only one node at a time is migrated from microk8s to the k3s cluster.  If a node fails the entire migration process will stop.  Subsequent runs will not attempt to migrate nodes which have already been migrated.

**What happens for each worker node:**
1. **Removal**: Removes node from Chutes inventory, and from microk8s cluster
2. **Reset**: Stops MicroK8s, cleans system, reboots the GPU node
3. **Setup**: Installs system packages, configures environment
4. **K3s Setup**: Installs and configures K3s agent
5. **Karmada Join**: Registers node with K3s control plane
6. **Re-registration**: Adds node back to Chutes inventory

### 2.4 Cleanup

1. Remove the microk8s group from the ansible inventory
2. Clean up the old microk8s control node.
3. Deploy the standard or your customized gepetto code to the new cluster once all nodes have been migrated over.  See the [docs](../../README.md#5-update-gepetto-with-your-optimized-strategy) for how to update the gepetto code config map.

### Complete Migration

To ensure each phase is executed properly it is not recommended to run the entire migration playbook at once.  Run each section above to ensure the new control plane is properly set up.  Once the new control plan is verified run the preparation plays to ensure all GPU information is captured, gepetto is updated to avoid the reconciliation loop deleting all deployed chutes, and the CLI is accessible and functioning prior to node migration.  Finally you can run the node migration to move nodes from the old cluster to the new cluster.

## Migration Markers

The playbook uses marker files in `/etc/ansible/` to track migration progress:

- `.removed`: Node removed from Chutes
- `.reset`: System reset completed
- `.setup`: Common setup completed
- `.k3s`: K3s installation completed
- `.karmada`: Karmada join completed
- `.added`: Node re-added to Chutes
- `.migrated`: Complete migration finished

These markers enable:
- **Resume capability**: Restart migration from where it left off
- **Idempotency**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Selective operations**: Target specific migration steps

## Usage Examples

### Basic Migration

```bash
# Setup the control plane
ansible-playbook -i ~/chutes/inventory.yml playbooks/migrate.yml --tags setup-control-plane

# Migrate specific nodes
ansible-playbook -i ~/chutes/inventory.yml playbooks/migrate.yml --limit chutes-miner-gpu-0 --tags migrate-nodes
```

### Preparation Commands

```bash
# Verify CLI and gather node info
ansible-playbook -i ~/chutes/inventory.yml playbooks/migrate.yml --tags verify-cli,get-node-info

# Re-verify Chutes components
ansible-playbook -i ~/chutes/inventory.yml playbooks/migrate.yml --tags verify-chutes
```

### Recovery Scenarios

```bash
# Clear migration markers to restart
ansible workers -b -m file -a "path=/etc/ansible/.migrated state=absent"

# Reset single node completely
ansible chutes-miner-gpu-0 -b -m file -a "path=/etc/ansible state=absent recurse=yes"
```

## CLI Execution Modes

### Remote Execution (Default)

- `chutes-miner` commands run on ansible hosts for the microk8s and control groups
- Requires `chutes-miner-cli` installed on each control node
- Hotkey copied to remote nodes if `copy_hotkey_to_ansible_host: true`
    - If the hotkey already exists on the node you can simply update the `remote_hotkey_path` instead of using ansible to copy the hotkey over

### Local Execution

Set `run_cli_locally: true` to:
- Run `chutes-miner` commands from Ansible controller
- Requires `chutes-miner-cli` on controller only
- Uses `--miner-api` flag to connect to remote APIs

## Migration Verification

### Verify Control Plane

```bash
# Check Chutes components
kubectl --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml get pods -n chutes
```

### Verify Worker Nodes

```bash
# Check K3s status
ansible -i inventory.yml workers -b -m command -a "systemctl status k3s-agent"

# Verify node labels
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

## Monitoring and Observability

The migration sets up monitoring components:

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection on port 30090
- **Grafana**: Dashboard on port 30080 (chutes/chutethis)
- **Node Exporter**: Node metrics on port 9100

Access dashboards at:
- Grafana: `http://<control-node>:30080`
- Prometheus: `http://<control-node>:30090`

## Security Considerations

- **Hotkeys**: Stored in `/etc/chutes-miner/` with 600 permissions
- **Certificates**: Auto-generated for components
- **Network**: UFW rules configured for required ports

## Rollback Procedures

If migration fails and rollback to MicroK8s is needed:

1. **Remove migration markers**:
   ```bash
   ansible workers -i ~/chutes/inventory.yml -b -m file -a "path=/etc/ansible state=absent recurse=yes"
   ```

2. **Reset nodes completely**:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i ~/chutes/inventory.yml playbooks/reset.yml
   ```

3. **Reinstall MicroK8s** (fully manual — the MicroK8s ansible has been removed from this repo; restore it from an older tag/commit if you truly need it)

## Kubectl and Cluster Management Setup

The migration playbook no longer copies kubeconfigs around. Each cluster keeps its canonical configuration at `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`, and Ansible (plus any validation checks) interact with the API by passing that path directly to kubectl/helm.

If you want a consolidated kubeconfig on your workstation or controller, run `chutes-miner-cli sync-kubeconfig` or manually copy the individual files via `scp user@node:/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/chutes/<node>.yaml` and set `KUBECONFIG` accordingly.

### Cluster Management Utilities

The playbook installs additional utilities to simplify multi-cluster operations:

**ktx (Kube Context Switcher):**
![Terminal Demo](../../assets/gifs/ktx.gif)
- Installed on control nodes from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blendle/kns/master/bin/ktx`
- Quickly switch between kubernetes contexts
- Usage: `ktx` to list and select contexts interactively

**kns (Kube Namespace Switcher):**
![Terminal Demo](../../assets/gifs/kns.gif)
- Installed on all nodes from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blendle/kns/master/bin/kns`
- Quickly switch between kubernetes namespaces
- Usage: `kns` to list and select namespaces interactively
- Requires `fzf` (automatically installed)

### Available Contexts After Migration

```bash
# List available contexts in a merged kubeconfig (if you synced one locally)
kubectl config get-contexts

# Otherwise, pass --kubeconfig explicitly:
kubectl --kubeconfig ~/chutes/chutes-miner-gpu-0.yaml get nodes
```
