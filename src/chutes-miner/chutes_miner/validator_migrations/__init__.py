"""
Validator migrations: one-time steps at Gepetto startup that call the validator
API to sync local state (e.g. re-key servers from UID to hotkey+server_name).

Each migration has a unique key YYYYMMDDXX (date + two-digit index). We run in
sorted order by key. Only migrations after the latest completed key are run
(so deleting old rows from the DB never causes earlier migrations to re-run).
On any failure we do not record and re-raise so the pod exits.
